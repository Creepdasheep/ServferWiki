## After boiling

Depending on the Recipe, some Steps may not be needed, the following instruction describes the common procedure of brewing.

### Fermenting

Step one consists of Fermenting the fresh Ingredients.

1. Place Cauldron over a Fire or other heat source
2. Fill it with water
3. Add Ingredients with a rightclick
4. Wait a few minutes while they ferment
5. Fill in glass bottles


Use a clock on a cauldron, if you want to know the time the ingredients have been fermenting.

### Distilling

Some Recipes don't need distilling.
1. Put the bottle with ferment into the brewing stand
2. Put glowstone dust as filter on top into the brewing stand (The filter will not be consumed)

### Aging

A barrel is needed for aging. 

**Minecraft Barrel** | _6 Slots_

The [Minecraft-Barrel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Barrel) can be used for aging of a few brews.
Simply craft and place the barrel and put the brews inside.

You can also build bigger barrels. They can be built in two ways:

**Small barrel** | _9 Slots_

Use 8 wooden stairs to build a barrel shape.

Place a Sign on the lower right side and write "Barrel" in the upper Line:

Message "Barrel created" should appear.


**Big barrel** | _27 Slots_

Use 5 Fences, 16 Wooden stairs, and 18 wood planks to build a barrel shape.
Attach a Spigot (Fence) and a Sign that has "Barrel" written on it:

Message "Barrel created" should appear  
**You may remove the Sign from the Big Barrel after creating it.**

------


Open the Barrel by clicking on it.

* Put the Bottles into the Barrels for aging.  
* For every Minecraft Day, the brews will age a year.  
* Depending on the Recipe, the Type of wood used for building the barrel may alter the quality of the aged Brew.
* The Minecraft-barrel is always of wood type oak.

### Drinking

The Amount of Alcohol inside the Brew will be applied to the player when drinking. Depending on the quality of it, that may have different effects.

* The Player may not be able to walk normally anymore, he will weave, making it almost impossible to walk straight
* Effects like Blindness, Confusion, Poison etc. occur
* The Chat will be altered depending on drunkeness, many things players write may be incomprehensible, sometimes it seems senseless
* Is the Alcohol particularly strong, it may have poisonous effects
* After drinking a lot, there is a chance of vomiting
* When logging off, the player may have difficulties reaching his character, thus some loggins shortly after may be denied
* After Overdrinking the player may faint (Disconnecting)

### Getting Sober

After drinking it takes a while until the alcohol is completely gone. During that time the alcohol level is steadily decreasing. Also it can be decreased through consuming of items defined in the config.

* When logging off extremely drunk, it may happen that, if the player logs back in after a while, he may find himself at an completely unknown Place in the middle of nowhere having no idea how he got there.
* Also if the Alcohol was not of best quality, the player may face some bad type of hangover (slowness and hunger).
